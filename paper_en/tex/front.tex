\section*{Abstract}

We present a~simple programming language Spiral and its implementation. Spiral
is an impure untyped functional language inspired by Scheme, featuring
first-class functions, tail-calls, module system and both mutable and immutable
data structures. We first translate the source language to Spine, a
continuation-passing style functional language. Spine is then transformed into
low-level imperative language Grit. Several optimization passes operate on this
intermediate language, including global value analysis and inlining. As the last
step of the compilation pipeline, we generate assembly, translate it with an
external assembler and link the resulting object file with the runtime library.
The runtime, written in \Cplusplus, defines core functions and objects and
manages the heap with a~moving garbage collector. The implementation includes a
basic standard library.
